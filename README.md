<h1 align="center">FORTUNE'S FABLE</h1>
October 20, 2024 - It was 3AM and I just finished my homework: create an interactive game using Java.
It is programmed by me and written by my friend which was my partner for this assignment. Here is the
game with the code untouched. I barely had any idea how to code in that time. Feel free to improve or
expand it if you like!
